(* Given a command line that sets a pattern for files to read, starts to
 * inotify those directories and for each file pass its name to each reader
 * plugins. Once one accept it then use it.  file reader plugins register one
 * function: val accept_filename: string -> (unit -> 'a option) option where 'a
 * is the event. The idea of course is that we want to be able to no depend on
 * PV CSV format.  Alternatively, when we register a reader we also configure
 * this reader with a file pattern. *)
