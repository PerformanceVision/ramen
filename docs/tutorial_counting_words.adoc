== The problem

In this tutorial we divert from network monitoring to turn to the "hello
world" of stream processing: a word count. Let's start by acknowledging that
counting words is a task that's best tackled with a map-reducer than with a
stream processor, but let's cling to the tradition.

Here is how the word count should work: you send in some prose and the stream
processor split it into individual words and count how many occurrences of
each of them have been seen so far, and output that count for each word. It
must outputs a tuple composed of the word and its count each time this word
is seen. This is a bit different from the map-reduce version of the word
counter, where only the final counts are emitted; but there is no such thing
as a final state for data streams.

This simple task is composed of 3 successive operations:

1. Read the prose and inject it line by line;
2. Split each line into individual words and output one tuple per word;
3. For each different word, count how many times we have seen it so far,
   and output a tuple with this word and count.

=== Accepting prose and outputting lines

So far the only way to inject new data into Ramen is the +LISTEN FOR+
operation. This operation is meant to understand well known protocols but
there is no well known protocols to transport prose. Instead, we will use the
other operation that can read data from the outside: +READ FILE+.

+READ FILE+ can either read one (or several) files from the file system, or
receive them via the HTTP server. It currently supports only files that
are in the CSV format but will later be expended to accept files in other
record oriented format footnote:[another good candidate for further expansion
is to read from a database]. To read files from the file system, the syntax
is:

[source,sql]
----
READ [ AND DELETE ] FILES "...pattern..."
  [ PREPROCESS WITH "...command..." ]
  [ SEPARATOR "..." ] [ NULL "..." ]
  ( field_name1 field_type1 [ [ NOT ] NULL ],
    field_name1 field_type1 [ [ NOT ] NULL ],
    ... )
----

- If +AND DELETE+ is specified then the files will be deleted as soon as
they have been opened, meaning they won't be injected again if you restart
Ramen.

- The file pattern here can use the wildcard +*+ anywhere _in a file name_;
  Ramen will keep looking for new files matching that pattern in that directory, so you can keep copying new files there.

- The optional +PREPROCESS WITH+ stanza specifies an external command to run
  on each file before reading it, such as for instance "zcat" to uncompress it.
  The supplied command must read from stdin and output to stdout.

- +SEPARATOR+ and +NULL+ sets the CSV field separator and placeholder value
  for NULL values. By default they are the coma and the empty string.

- Then follow the description of the fields, with name, type and nullability.

If instead of reading files you prefer to upload them via HTTP, replace the
first line above by: +RECEIVE+. Then, just POST the files to Ramen at the
URL +/upload/+ followed by the node fully qualified name. This is what we
will do in this example for simplicity.

Also, we will send prose not CSV. But if the CSV separator does not appear
anywhere in the file, then prose is indistinguishable from a CSV file of
one single field for the whole line. So the first node injecting lines
would be:

[source,sql]
----
RECEIVE SEPARATOR "_" (line STRING NOT NULL)
----

Go ahead and create a layer named "word_count" with a node named "receiver"
with that simple operation.

Next, we want to split those lines.

=== String Splitting and Multiple Outputs

The function we need for splitting incoming lines is +split+, which takes two
strings as arguments: the separator and the string to split, in that order.

It will return from 1 (if the separator is not found) to many results.

When a function outputs several results then as many tuple will be output by
the node. That is, for one input there will be N outputs. When the SELECT
statement uses several such functions returning multiple results then the
Cartesian product of all those results is output.

So for instance the output tuples of +split(" ", "foo bar"), 42+ would be:

  "foo", 42
  "bar", 42

and the output tuples of +split(" ", "foo bar"), 42, split(" ", "baz bam")+
would be:

  "foo", 42, "baz"
  "foo", 42, "bam"
  "bar", 42, "baz"
  "bar", 42, "bam"

In our case we just want to split incoming field +line+ by spaces:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT SPLIT(" ", line) AS word FROM receiver
----

We could also turn all words to lowercase with the +lower+ function:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT LOWER(SPLIT(" ", line)) AS word FROM receiver
----

In that case the function +lower+ would of course be applied to each of +split+
results.

WARNING: Notice that function names are case insensitive but keep in mind that
field names are _not_!

Easy enough. Let's call this node "splitter" and proceed to the actual
counting.

=== Counting Words

Intuitively one might expect something like the following SQL:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT word, COUNT(*) AS count FROM splitter GROUP BY word
----

and indeed this is a good starting point. Ramen, though, does not have a
+COUNT+ keyword yet; instead, we could count ourselves by adding ones:

[source,sql]
-----
SELECT word, SUM 1 AS count FROM splitter GROUP BY word
-----

Equivalently, there is also the _virtual field_ +group.#count+ that counts
how many elements have been added to a group. We will see later about virtual
fields.

The main difference with SQL, though, is the lack of an implicit moment when to
stop aggregating. For such a simple problem as word counting, traditional
windowing where we issue a tuple and flush the aggregation when some condition
is met won't cut it: we want a new tuple each time a count changes, but we want
to keep forever increasing the counters.

If we did:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT word, SUM 1 AS count FROM splitter GROUP BY word
COMMIT WHEN out.count <> previous.count
----

...then we would have a succession of tuple with all counts equal to 2, emitted
every time a word is encountered for the second time. That would not be very
useful.

[NOTE]
Notice there is an +out+ special tuple in addition to the +previous+ special
tuple we've seen earlier.

[NOTE]
To understand why we would have a count of 2 rather than 1, you must be aware
that the previous tuple is initialized with the first one when an new group is
created (to avoid having to deal with yet another case of nulls). So when a
word is seen for the first time its previous.count is not 0 as you might expect
but equal to out.count, that is 1. So one must wait until the second occurrence
of that word for the +COMMIT+ condition to be true.

What we really want to do is to aggregate the counts forever, but still emit
a new tuple at every change (aka at every step). Fortunately we can set
a different condition for when to +COMMIT+ a result (ie. output the result
tuple) than the condition for when to +FLUSH+ the aggregated group:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT word, SUM 1 AS count FROM splitter GROUP BY word
COMMIT WHEN true FLUSH WHEN false
EXPORT
----

Simple, and does the work. You will see later that, not only can we set a
specific condition as to when to flush but we can also select which tuples to
flush and which to keep from one window to the next.

There you have it. We added an +EXPORT+ keyword at the end of this new
"counter" node so that you can see the result in the GUI. Let's now send some
text.

=== Uploading Some Prose

By default, Ramen listens at port 29380 and so, to
upload data for our node which fully qualified name is +word_count/receiver+ a
file has to be HTTP POSTed to
+http://localhost:29380/upload/word_count/receiver+. For instance with curl:

[source,shell]
----
~ % curl --data-urlencode "hello world" \
    http://localhost:29380/upload/word_count/receiver
{"success": true}
~ % curl --data "hello again" \
    http://localhost:29380/upload/word_count/receiver
{"success": true}
----

As you can see Ramen is not very picky regarding content types.

On the GUI you should have:

.Raw Output
[width="50%",cols="^,^",options="header"]
|========================
|word +
string
|count +
i8
|hello |1
|world |1
|hello |2
|again |1
|========================

as expected we have as many tuples as we had words in the input, with the
count counting the number of occurrences of each.
